            <h3>Engineering Design I: Teddy Bear WheelChair (Robotic Device)</h3>
            <h4>In our first-year design course (ENGG*1100), my interdisciplinary team and I were tasked with designing, building, and coding a wheelchair for a teddy bear. 
                The project was both fun and challenging as we had to ensure the wheelchair could complete various tests to assess its performance and accuracy. One of the most 
                interesting parts of the project was a target-practice test, where we had to integrate a ping-pong projectile system into the design. It was a great way to apply 
                our knowledge and work together as a team.</h4>

            <h4>Arranging the Breadboard and Components</h4>
            <h4>First, I placed the motor driver IC on the breadboard just as it appears in the picture above. I make sure it’s positioned in a central location on the breadboard to 
                easily connect it to other components. Then, I grab some jumper wires and start connecting the Arduino to the breadboard. I usually like to use different colors for 
                different purposes—red for power, black for ground, and other colors for signal lines, which helps me keep track of the connections more easily.</h4>
            <h4>Connecting the Motor</h4>
            <h4>Next, I attached the motor to the motor driver. I double-checked the motor’s documentation to make sure I’m aware of its current and voltage requirements. 
                This ensures I make the connections securely and avoid any potential short circuits or damage to the motor and driver. I connect the motor leads to the output terminals of 
                the motor driver, carefully noting the polarity to ensure correct directional movement.</h4>
            <h4>Power Connections</h4>
            <h4>Finally, I connected the battery clip to the breadboard. I plugged the red wire into the breadboard’s positive rail and the black wire into the negative rail. 
                I then used jumper wires to extend power from the breadboard’s power rails to both the Arduino and the motor driver IC. It’s crucial to make sure that both components 
                received the correct voltage; for the Arduino, it’s typically 5V, and the motor driver’s voltage varied depending on the motor’s specifications.</h4>

            <h4>Initially, the vehicle was powered directly by a battery source, but we observed that we could enhance the setup. To do this, we decided to reroute one of 
                the red wires. Originally, this wire was connected directly to the battery. We changed its connection point on the breadboard to a different slot specifically 
                meant for a stable voltage supply.</h4>
            <h4>This alteration was crucial because it allowed us to better manage the power distribution across the vehicle’s circuit. By connecting the red wire to a voltage 
                slot on the breadboard, we effectively centralized the power distribution, which helped in stabilizing the motor operation and the overall functionality of the vehicle. 
                It’s a simple change, but it makes the vehicle more reliable because the voltage regulation is more consistent.</h4>
            <h4>After making this change, we thoroughly tested the vehicle to ensure it operated correctly. We wanted to be certain that it could move back and forth reliably, 
                which it did, proving our modification was successful. This was a great relief and a point of satisfaction for us, as it confirmed our understanding and application 
                of basic electronic and power distribution principles.</h4>
